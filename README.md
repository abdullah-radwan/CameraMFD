# Camera MFD
Camera MFD sets cameras on Orbiter vessels which can be fully control.

## Installation
Go to releases and download the latest release. Unzip the file directly into the Orbiter folder.

## Build
Download the source into a folder in Orbitersdk/samples, then retarget the solution to your Windows SDK and build normally.

The compiled version should appear in Modules/Plugin folder.
