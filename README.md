# Camera MFD
Camera MFD is an MFD that sets a custom camera on the focus vessel and allows you to set the camera coordinates and direction.

Note: The axes vary from vessel to another, so the buttons may look reversed.

## Installation
Go to releases and download the latest release. Unzip the file directly into Orbiter installation.

## Build
Download the source into a folder in Orbitersdk/samples, then retarget the solution to your Windows SDK and build normally.

The compiled version should appear in Modules/Plugin folder.

## About
The MFD is based on Orbiter 2016 API, D3D9 client, Visual Studio 2017 and C++. Any suggestions, bugs and contributes are welcomed.
